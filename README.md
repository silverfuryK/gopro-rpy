# GoPro RPY

A proof-of-concept to use gopro-telemetry to automatically adjust roll, pitch, and yaw in processed equirectangular videos/

Read this post for a bit more information about our thought processes in building this: https://www.trekview.org/blog/2022/calculating-heading-of-gopro-video-using-gpmf-part-1/

## Prerequisites

1. First extract the telemetry file (as json) from your GoPro video using [gopro-telemetry](https://github.com/JuanIrache/gopro-telemetry/). [Detailed instructions about how to do this can be found in this post](https://www.trekview.org/blog/2022/gopro-telemetry-exporter-getting-started/).
2. Install required packages `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

add arguments in command line

```shell
python3 main.py [.json file name/ file path] [--video_input video file path] [--plot True] [--mode roll,pitch,yaw]
```

`--video_input` argument is optional, a video file path to process. To be used along with --mode option.

`--plot` argument is optional, only put some value when plots are required.

`--mode` argument is optional, a comma-seperated mode to adjust roll, pitch, or yaw. Defaults to yaw.

### Example usage

1. To just update the .json file with new data

```shell
python3 main.py	GS019049.json
```

2. To update the .json file with new data and create plots of the roll pitch yaw and magnetic heading 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS019049.json --plot true
```

3. To adjust yaw of worldlocked 360 video. 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS010013-worldlock.json --video_input GS010011-worldlock.mp4 --mode yaw
```

4. To level horizon using roll on 360 video. 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS010011-roll.json --video_input GS010011.mp4 --mode roll
```

5. To level horizon using pitch on 360 video. 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS010010-pitch.json --video_input GS010010.mp4 --mode pitch
```

## Camera support

This script has been tested and confirmed working for:

* GoPro MAX running firmware: H19.03.02.00.00 (shows on camera LCD as 02.00)

## How it works

### 1. Calculating yaw, pitch and roll values

Camera orientation `CORI` is a relative measurement (the orientation relative to the orientation the sensor had when the acquisition started). It is reported in Quaternions in the order `w`,`x`,`y`,`z` in gopro-telemetry.

```json
"CORI":{
  "samples":[{
    "value":[0.9989318521683401,-0.024964140751365705,0.02621539963988159,0.029206213568529312],
    "cts":176.62,
    "date":"2022-05-26T08:35:42.485Z",
    "sticky":{
      "VPTS":1261037}
    },
```

To calculate yaw, pitch and roll values from this data we take the four Quarternation values (Euler Parameters) and convert them into Euler angles on each axis.

The equations to do this are somewhat complex, as you'll see from a cursory scan of this Wikipedia article; [Conversion between Quaternions and Euler angles](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles), or by examining the code in `main.py`.

### 2. Calculating heading values

Values from the Magnetometer are reported in the axis order `z`,`x`,`y` in MicroTeslas in gopro-telemetry. 

```json
"MAGN":{
	"samples":[{
		"value":[-4,88,27],
		"cts":163.461,
		"date":"2022-05-26T08:35:42.485Z"
	},
```

To calculate heading values we first sync `MAGN` samples with their closest `CORI` sample.

Once the times have been synced and each `MAGN` sample has a corresponding `CORI` sample we can calculate the magnetic heading using the formula:

```
Mx = mx * cos(p) + my * sin(p)
My = mx * cos(r) * sin(p) + my * cos(r) + mz * sin(r) * cos (p)
M_yaw = atan2(My,Mx)
```

Where:

* `mx` = magnetometer x reading
* `my` = magnetometer y reading
* `mz` = magnetometer z reading
* `r` = roll angle
* `p` = pitch angle

_Be careful not to confuse `My` and `my` / `Mx` and `mx` (they are different variables). For clarity; `my` is the magnetic component in y direction, `My` is the output of the second equation which is approximately corrected y component of the magnetic field. The same explanation applies for `Mx` and `mx`._

### 3. Writing new values to gopro-telemetry

This script then writes out a new telemetry file (`INPUT-calculated.json`) with the following values:

* `RPYR`:
	* name: roll, pitch, yaw (x,y,z)
	* units: radians
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
* `RPYD`
	* name: roll, pitch, yaw (x,y,z)
	* units: degrees
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
* `HEAR`
	* name: magnetic heading
	* units: radians
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
* `HEAD`
	* name: magnetic heading
	* units: degrees
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ

For reference, here's a sample of the first and last `HEAD` entry in a telemetry file to demo the structure of the object;

```json
"HEAD": {
	"samples": [
		{
			"value": 2.4325704405863235,
			"cts": 189.758,
			"date": "2022-06-08T11:46:54.225Z"
		},
```

...


```json
		{
			"value": -1.9311572331906321,
			"cts": 21121.995333333347,
			"date": "2022-06-08T11:47:15.591Z"
		}
	],
	"name": "magnetic heading",
	"units": "degrees"
	}
},
```
